## About

This repository contains my configuration files.
They are mainly intended for personal use, but since I am regularly asked how I've set up a certain program I'm happy to share this repository with everyone.

Some configuration files are inspired by other repositories, others were originally authored by myself.
I've tried to give credit where appropriate, but I might have missed something.

You may encounter encrypted files in other parts of this repository.
These contain sensitive information and are hence not publicly available.
